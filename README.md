## Overview
Gitmails Shell, or Gitmails-sh, is a port of the official [Gitmails tool](https://github.com/giovanifss/Gitmails) to
POSIX shell.

The Goal of the port is to require even less dependencies, leaning on common system programs, avoiding python and
interacting directly with git, gathering more data easily.

## Development and Contributions
Development is in a very slow pace, but contributions are welcome.
